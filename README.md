# This code is a Java program that calculates the salary of an employee based on their hourly rate and hours worked. It prompts the user to enter the hourly rate and hours worked using the Scanner class. Then, it calls the calculateSalary method to perform the calculation. The calculateSalary method takes the hourly rate and hours worked as parameters and calculates the base salary by multiplying the hourly rate by the hours worked. It also calculates any overtime pay if the hours worked exceed 40 hours. The overtime rate is 1.5 times the hourly rate, and the overtime hours are the difference between the hours worked and 40 (capped at 0 if the hours worked are less than or equal to 40). The total salary, including any overtime pay, is then returned and displayed to the user.
